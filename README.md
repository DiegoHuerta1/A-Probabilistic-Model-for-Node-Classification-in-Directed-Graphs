# A-Probabilistic-Model-for-Node-Classification-in-Directed-Graphs


In this work, we present a probabilistic model 
for directed graphs where nodes have
attributes and labels. 
This model serves as a generative classifier
capable of predicting the labels of unseen nodes
using either maximum likelihood or 
maximum a posteriori estimations. 
Importantly, 
the predictions made by this model 
are highly interpretable, 
contrasting with some common methods
for node classification,
such as graph neural networks.
We applied the model to two datasets, 
demonstrating predictive performance 
that is competitive with, 
and even superior to,
state-of-the-art methods.
One of the datasets considered is adapted 
from the Math Genealogy Project, 
which has not previously been utilized for this purpose. 
Consequently, we evaluated several methods
on this dataset to compare the performance 
of our model and provide benchmarks for this new resource.
